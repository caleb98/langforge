## Running in an IDE

This project uses JavaFX. While the gradle plugin will handle configuring JavaFX when running with `gradle run`, IDEs may require some extra setup. See [Getting Started with JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) for details. When setting up your JavaFX SDK for your IDE, ensure that you use an SDK version matching the JavaFX version listed in the `build.gradle` file.
